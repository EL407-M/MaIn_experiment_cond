    When you are active, <b>you will not know the type of the participant</b> you are paired with.
    However, <b>you will receive a clue</b> about your potential partner’s type. Clues are determined in the following way.
    The computer will digitally draw a random ball from <b>a box containing 24 balls</b> of different colors.
    Each ball can be either <b>blue, yellow or red</b>.
    The number of blue, yellow and red balls in <b>the box depends on your partner’s type</b>.
    For example, consider the boxes illustrated in the figure below.
    If your partner’s type is X, the box contains no blue balls, 12 yellow balls and 12 red balls.
    If your partner’s type is Y, the box contains 24 yellow balls but no blue or red balls.
    If your partner’s type is Z, the box contains 12 blue balls, 12 yellow balls and no red balls.

<p>
    To give you a clue about the type of your potential partner, <b>the computer will first determine which box to use given your partner’s type</b>.
    Then <b>it will digitally draw a random ball</b>: each single ball in the box has the same probability of being selected, equal to 1/24.
    The clue you receive is the color of this randomly drawn ball.
